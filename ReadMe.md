# Polynomial Solver from Roots

This project computes the coefficients of a polynomial given its roots in various bases.

## Problem Statement
- Input is given in JSON format with roots expressed in different bases.
- The task is to convert roots to decimal, then compute the polynomial coefficients.
- Polynomial degree = k - 1, where k roots are required.

## How to Compile & Run

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o solver
./solver
